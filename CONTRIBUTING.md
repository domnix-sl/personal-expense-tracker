## üìã Development Guidelines

### üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

The project follows a simple layered architecture:

```
src/main/java/com/expensetracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.java                 # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseTracker.java       # Main application logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Expense.java          # Data model
```

### üîß Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Update the Model** (if needed)
   - Add new fields or methods to `Expense.java`
   - Ensure proper encapsulation

2. **Extend the Service Layer**
   - Add new methods to `ExpenseTracker.java`
   - Follow existing patterns for user interaction

3. **Update the Menu System**
   - Add new menu options in the `showMenu()` method
   - Handle new cases in the main switch statement

4. **Add Tests**
   - Create test cases for new functionality
   - Ensure edge cases are covered

### üß™ Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate

Example test structure:
```java
@Test
public void testAddExpense() {
    // Arrange
    ExpenseTracker tracker = new ExpenseTracker();
    
    // Act
    tracker.addExpense("Coffee", 4.50, "Food");
    
    // Assert
    assertEquals(1, tracker.getExpenseCount());
}
```
